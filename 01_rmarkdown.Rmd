## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r,include=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
library(PythonInR)
py_available()
use_condaenv("r-reticulate")
```

```{python}
import pandas
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets.samples_generator import make_blobs
data, target = make_blobs(n_samples=1000, n_features=2, centers=[[-2,-2],[1,1],[3,3],[5,5]], cluster_std=[0.4,0.2,0.1,0.3], random_state=7)

plt.scatter(data[:, 0], data[: ,1], c=target, marker='o')
plt.show()
```
